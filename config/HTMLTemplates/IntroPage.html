<center><h2>Introduction to COAST</h2></center>

<hr align=center width=60%>
<p>COAST is a
  platform for developing and deploying World Wide Web applications. For development, it
  provides an extensible framework, reusable components, and a configuration mechanism that
  is used to create web applications. For deployment, it provides an efficient and scaleable
  server and additional flexible communication infrastructure.</p>
<p>This Introduction with all the receipes will show you roughly how the framework 'COAST' can be adapted to your needs by configuring it and adding a few lines of code.(For the very first steps see as well 'Tips and Hints' on the next page.)<br></p>

<hr align=center width=60%>
<p>In every recipe we tried to answer of a typical question <i>'how can I do ... ?'</i>. Therefore this application can be viewed as an example application 
of the recipes we thought out. 
 <br>Where it is appropriate the example code of a recipe starts from the same page. 
 In addition there are hints (in italics) to the recipe that created an item on the page or 
 to the corresponding file it was defined in.</p>
<p>We suggest that you first read the recipe you are interested in and then 
try to find the corresponding parts in the HTML, configuration or program code files of this example application. 
That's why you should always come back to the next page which is the list of all recipes.</p>

<p>Please note: At the bottom of each page you'll find some debug information about role, page and action.</p>
