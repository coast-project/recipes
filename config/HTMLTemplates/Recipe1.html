<center><h2>[[#wd Lookup TitleRecipe1 ]]</h2></center>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A new page is incorporated into an existing WebDisplay project, using an
already defined superpage by the following steps:
<ul>
	<li>Add the new page name to the config.any slot /Pages (<i>MyNewPage</i>).</li>
	<li>Create a configuration file for the new page (<i>MyNewPage.any</i>).</li>
	<li>Update the navigation maps in the configuration of roles that are allowed
		to access the new page. (<i>/Map in Role.any</i>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preconditions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The config.any file exists and contains a valid WebDisplay application
		configuration.</li>
	<li>There exists an appropriate and valid "super page" with a corresponding
configuration file "SuperPage.any" (e.g. Page.any for pages instantiated
from class Page)</li>
	<li>There is already a HTML template file "SharedPageTemplate.html" file that
defines the general layout of our new page. For the example the SharedPageTemplate.html
looks like this:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"&lt;html>"
		"	&lt;head>"
		"		&lt;title>"
		"			[[&#35;wd Lookup PageTitle &#93;&#93;"
		"		&lt;/title>"
		"	&lt;/head>"
		"	&lt;body background= imagedir/backgrnd.gif >"
		"		[[&#35;wd Lookup Header &#93;&#93;"
		"		[[&#35;wd Lookup Body &#93;&#93;"
		"		[[&#35;wd Lookup Footer &#93;&#93;"
		"	&lt;/body>"
		"&lt;/html>"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
</ol>
<i><font size=-1><b>Explanation:</b> This HTML template file defines several
places for WebDisplay to fill in. Each of these places is specified using
the macro-extension mechanism with a pair of double square brackets ([[&#35;wd
... ]]). The &#35;wd specifies this as a WebDisplay macro. The rest of the
macro is a Renderer specification. This can be given literally using the
renderer name (Image) and an Anything defining the renderers parameters.
Note that Lookup stands short for ContextLookupRenderer, which in turn looks
in the context for a renderer specification with the given name (e.g. Footer).
These renderer specifications are to be given by the derived pages configuration
files.</font></i>
<h3>Steps to do:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Add the page name to the appropriate slot in the config.any file's /Pages
slot. This structure allows you to define multiple pages to be derived
from a single C++ class derived from class Page. These pages share the
same program code but differ in their configuration. In addition the configurations
of such derived pages are also "inherited". That allows you to specify
new pages by just giving the differences in configuration regarding the
"super page". In our example the new page named InfoPage is given as an
instance of the Page (C++-)class:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"{"
		"	/Pages { # define the hierarchy of pages in the application"
		"		/Page { # define subordinate configurations"
		"			&#34;InfoPage&#34; #there may be some more derived pages here"
		"		}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre></li>
	<li>Create a new configuration file for the page added (named InfoPage.any).
Define all the page dependend Renderer specifications that are used by
the HTML template used for your page (SharedPageTemplate.html in the example).
Because page configurations are "inherited" you might rely on renderer
configurations already given by the "super page". For example the PageTitle
and Body are specific to InfoPage, whereas the other Renderer specifications
(Header, Footer) are taken from Page.any. The resulting file InfoPage.any
might look like:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"{"
		"	/PageTitle &#34;This is the Info Page&#34;"
		"	/Body {"
		"		/Form {"
		"			/Template {"
		"				&#34;Hello - This is my InfoPage&#34;"
		"				&#34;[[&#35;wd Lookup GoBackButton &#93;&#93;&#34;"
		"			}"
		"			/Method &#34;GET&#34;"
		"			/Action &#34;GoFirstPage&#34;"
		"		}"
		"	}"
		" "
		"#---- Parts ----------------------------------------------------------------"
		" "
		"	/GoBackButton {"
		"		/Button {"
		"			/Submit"
		"			/Label {"
		"				/String {"
		"					/Default &#34;Return to FirstPage&#34;"
		"				}"
		"			}"
		"		}"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre></li>
	<li>Update the role specific navigation maps for the new page in the configuration
files of each role you want to grant access to your page. The navigation
maps are normally located in a role's config file "Rolename.any". The navigation
map specifies two aspects:
	<ol>
		<li>The action name that will result in retrieving the new page from a special page<br>
			(<tt>/FirstPage {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/GoInfoPage "InfoPage"<br>}</tt>)</li>
		<li>The valid (non-default) actions for the role, once your new page was reached
			(<tt>/InfoPage {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/GoFirstPage "FirstPage"<br>}</tt>).</li>
	</ol>
	<p><i><font size=-1><b>Note:</b> The actions given here are simple names specifying
config entries and the resulting new pages' names. For actions that have
side effects and more functionality see another Receipe.</font></i>
	<p>For example Role.any contains:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/Map {"
		"	# the following actions are available for all pages&nbsp;"
		"	/Default {"
		"		/Home &#34;IntroPage&#34;"
		"	}"
		" "
		"	/FirstPage {"
		"		/GoNextPage     &#34;SecondPage&#34;"
		"		/GoInfoPage     &#34;InfoPage&#34;"
		"		/GoAnotherPage &#34;AnotherPage&#34;"
		"	 }"
		" "
		"	/InfoPage {"
		"		# additional actions and their resulting pages"
		"		/NextStep        &#34;FirstPage&#34;"
		"		/GoFirstPage    &#34;FirstPage&#34;"
		"	 }"
		"	 #... other pages navigation maps"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre></li>
</ol>
