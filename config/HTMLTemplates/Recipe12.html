<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>HTTP requests are short lived, e.g. get a html page or post some
data out of a form and be done with it. This sort of interaction style
assumes no relation between pages other than defined by the link structure
of html pages themselves. For an application like a shopping mall you need more
information to handle the interaction correctly. You need a session context
that holds accumulated information over a defined set of pages and
during some period of time. WebDisplay executes every request in a session
context, where you can store long lived data and accumulate the state
necessary to guide the interaction of your application.
<h3>Preconditions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Define the roles for your application.<br>
		Sample:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"Guest      Is allowed to browse publicly available information"
		"Shopper    Has acquired a shopping cart and already put items in it"
		"PShopper   A shopper who has already identified itself (e.g. by paying a bill)"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Define your page scope (it doesn't have to be the final page structure).<br>
		Sample:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"ShoppingPage"
		"	MallEntry"
		"	BookShop"
		"		TrivialLiterature"
		"		SF"
		"		ComputerBooks"
		"	VideoShop"
		"		Love Stories"
		"		Crime"
		"		Sex"
		"		Horror"
		"		War"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Define possible interactions with your application.<br>
		Sample:<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"	GoBookShop"
		"	GoVideoShop"
		"	GoBack"
		"	PutItemIntoCart"
		"	RemoveItemFromCart"
		"	EmptyCart"
		"	PayBill"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Steps to do:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Decide whether you need subclasses of roles or can do it with the built-in
		Role class of WebDisplay. You have to decide on the grounds of security
		considerations. If you just use a role to access a different set of pages but
		have no further security restrictions use the built-in role.<br><br>
	</li>
	<li>Define the set of pages belonging to one role. Implement a HTML-Prototype of
		some of the pages to test your concept.<br>
		For each page used define an entry in Config.any under the tag Pages. Since
		Pages have an inheritance relationship. It is possible to factor commonly used
		functionality into root pages.<br>
		Sample:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/Pages {"
		"	/Page { # the root of all pages"
		"		/ShoppingPage {     # specialized shopping page"
		"			EntryPage           # entrance into the shopping mall"
		"			/VideoShopPage {    # the video section of the mall"
		"				# specialized video shop pages"
		"				LoveStory Sex Crime Horror War"
		"			}"
		"			/BookShopPage {     # the book section of the mall"
		"				# specialized book shop pages"
		"				TrivialLit SF ComputerBooks"
		"			}"
		"			BillPage"
		"		}"
		"		/AdvertisingPage {      # advertising pages to draw in people passing by"
		"			NewMovies NewBooks"
		"		}"
		"		GeneralInformation"
		"		RelatedLinks"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		For each page you have to associate a configuration file. Therein you define
		the structure of the pages and dynamic elements of the pages. Try to factor
		commonly used elements into root pages. Use HTML-Templates to define the
		page structure (see [[#wd Lookup Recipe4 ]] and [[#wd Lookup Recipe5 ]] for details).<br><br>
	</li>
	<li>Define the navigation actions of your application and implement it in the action
		page map of the role. For each role you need to define the action-page map in the config
		file 'RoleName'.any.<br>
		Sample:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"#---- Action/Page Map -------------------------------------------------------------"
		"/Map {"
		"	/Default {	# list the actions available for all pages "
		"		/Home          EntryPage"
		"		/GoBookShop    BookShopPage"
		"		/GoVideoShop   VideoShopPage"
		"		/GoPayTheBill  BillPage"
		"	}"
		" "
		"	# list the specific action/page maps"
		"	/EntryPage         { ... }"
		"	/BookShopPage      { ... }"
		"	..."
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		If you use more than one role you have to define the actions that
		trigger role changes. Define them in the Config.any file under the tag 
		RoleChanges.<br>
		Sample:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/RoleChanges {"
		"	/CartGrabbed    Shopper"
		"	/BillPayed      PShopper"
		"	/CartEmptied    Guest"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		If you have decided that you need some custom-made roles, implement the C++-
		subclasses with the relevant security hooks (see [[#wd Lookup Recipe8 ]] and
		[[#wd Lookup Recipe9 ]] for details).<br><br>
	</li>
	<li>Define the actions triggering state changes in your application. Implement these
		actions as subclasses of C++-Class Action.<br>
		Sample:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"class PutItemIntoCart : public ShoppingAction {"
		"	public:"
		"		PutItemIntoCart();"
		"		~PutItemIntoCart();"
		"		bool DoAction(String &action, Context &c);"
		"};"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		Implement the DoAction routine. Here you are able to store away necessary
		session state for later use:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"bool PutItemIntoCart::DoAction(String &action, Context &c)"
		"{"
		"	Anything roleStore(c.GetRoleStore());	// fetch the actives role store"
		"	Anything tmpStore(c.GetTmpStore());		// fetch the temporary store"
		"	Anything queryStore(c.GetQuery());		// fetch the submitted query"
		" "
		"	// do whatever state changes or calculation are necessary"
		"	// by manipulating one of the stores above"
		"	// and by evaluating values of the submitted query"
		"	if ( queryStore.IsDefined(&#34;ShoppingItems&#34;) )"
		"	{"
		"		// access the query information relevant for this action"
		"		Anything newShoppingItems= queryStore[&#34;ShoppingItems&#34;];"
		" "
		"		// do something"
		"		for(long i= 0; i < newShoppingItems.GetSize(); i++)"
		"		{"
		"			roleStore[&#34;Cart&#34;][&#34;Items&#34;].Append(newShoppingItems[i]);"
		"		}"
		"	}"
		" "
		"	// Set an action that triggers a valid next page."
		"	// This return value might be unchanged that means stay"
		"	// on the same page."
		"	action = ...;"
		"	"
		"	return true;"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Define the pages that use the dynamically accumulated state to give
		the user feedback on his actions. If they only show data without
		calculation, you can use lookup renderers and html-templates to define
		your pages (see [[#wd Lookup Recipe4 ]]).<br>
		If you need to do some calculation before showing your page, you have to
		derive a C++-class from Page and implement the Page::Preprocess Method.<br>
		Sample:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"void ShoppingPage::Preprocess(Context &c)"
		"{"
		"	Anything roleStore(c.GetRoleStore());	// fetch the actives role store"
		"	Anything tmpStore(c.GetTmpStore());		// fetch the temporary store"
		"	Anything queryStore(c.GetQuery());		// fetch the submitted query"
		" "
		"	// calculate data needed for the rendering of the page"
		"	// e.g. the total amount of your items in the cart"
		"	Anything shoppingItems= roleStore[&#34;Cart&#34;][&#34;Items&#34;];"
		"	double totalAmount= 0;"
		" "
		"	for(long i= 0; i < shoppingItems.GetSize(); i++)"
		"	{"
		"		totalAmount += shoppingItems[i][&#34;Price&#34;].AsDouble();"
		"	}"
		" "
		"	// store it away in the tmpStore"
		"	// here they are available for the following renderers"
		"	tmpStore[&#34;TotalAmount&#34;]= totalAmount;"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Define the tags in your 'PageName'.any and 'PageName'.html files that use
		the dynamically calculated state.<br>
		Sample:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"..."
		"&lt;table border=0 bgcolor=&#34;#D8E7FF&#34; cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>"
		"	&lt;td>"
		"		Total Amount:"
		"	&lt;td>"
		"	&lt;td>"
		"		[[&#35;wd Lookup TotalAmount &#93;&#93;	&lt;!-- finds the value in tmpStore -->"
		"	&lt;/td>"
		"&lt;/table>"
		"..."
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
</ol>
