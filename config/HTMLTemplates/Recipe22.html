<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A ConditionalRenderer or a SwitchRenderer allows you to put a limited
amount of logic directly into your configuration files. <br>
(This may have advantages: In simple cases this may completely avoid having to write
C++ code. Anyhow configuration files are typically much easier
to change than C++ code.)
<p>At runtime both Renderers look up some state in the Context - i.e. in
one of the different stores making up the Context - and based on what
they find decide which subsequent Renderers to use.
<p>The difference between ConditionalRenderer and SwitchRenderer is that
ConditionalRenderer typically chooses among two alternatives - i.e. it
acts like a C++ if/else expression - whereas SwitchRenderer may choose
from multiple alternatives - i.e. it corresponds to a C++ switch construct.
<h3>Preconditions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>You need the Page - i.e. the respective Page configuration file - where
		you want to use the Renderer</li>
	<li>If you want to use any Renderer by an alias name be sure to include
		that name in the Renderers section of Config.any:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/Renderers {"
		"	...."
		"	/ConditionalRenderer	{	Condition	}"
		"	/SwitchRenderer			{	Switch		}"
		"	...."
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>ConditionalRenderer and SwitchRenderer both require as input a
		configuration Anything that specifies which condition to check and
		what alternatives to choose from.<br>
		Structure of a Renderer specification as expected by a ConditionalRenderer:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"{"
		"	/ContextCondition &#34;name&#34;"
		"	/True { Renderer descriptor for TestCondition == True }"
		"	/False { Renderer descriptor for TestCondition == False }"
		"	/Defined { Renderer descriptor for TestCondition == Defined }"
		"	/Undefined { Renderer descriptor for TestCondition == Undefined }"
		"	/Error { Renderer descriptor for TestCondition == Error }"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		Of this configuration Anything only the slot ContextCondition is mandatory.
		It specifies what slot name to use for the lookup in the Context
		(ContextCondition should therefore usually contain a string).
		<p>All the other slots then specify what to do - depending on the value that is
		looked up - and may be omited entirely.
		(If the value retrieved from the Context is a 'long', it is automatically
		interpreted as a Boolean - which is either 'True' or 'False'. Otherwise it
		is simply treated as either 'Defined' or 'Undefined'.)<br><br>
		Structure of a Renderer specification as expected by a SwitchRenderer:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"{"
		"	/ContextLookupName &#34;name&#34;"
		"	/Case {"
		"		/xxx { Renderer descriptor for TestCondition == xxx }"
		"		/yyy { Renderer descriptor for TestCondition == yyy }"
		"	}"
		"	/Default { Renderer descriptor for default case }"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		The configuration Anything for SwitchRenderer is very similar to the one
		used by ConditionalRenderer. Since SwitchRenderer does not treat the looked
		up value as either Boolean or as Defined/Undefined - but always as a String
		that is then directly used to decide what subsequent Renderer to use - in
		addition to the slot ContextCondition the configuration data must contain a
		Case slot that lists all the alternatives that are handled. (The slot
		"_Empty" handles the special case where the looked up value is empty. If the
		looked up value does not match any case defined in the Case section, the
		Renderer specification defined as Default - if present - is used.)
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Steps to do:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Identify the parts that you want to conditionally render and define
		the respective Renderer specifications.<br>
		Sample:<br>
		To ease debugging of your application you want to render some
		diagnostic output directly into each HTML page. However you want
		to switch off the debug output once your application goes productive.<br>
		You decide that while debugging you want to use the following Renderer
		specification in the footer of each page (This will render the Anything
		that is found at slot 'myData'..  additional output might be created):
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/DebugOutput {"
		"	/HTML {"
		"		/Template {"
		"			&#34;Diagnostic Output:&lt;br>&#34;"
		"			&#34;[[&#35;wd Lookup myData&#93;&#93;&#34;"
		"		}"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		Furthermore you decide that you do not want any debug output in the
		productive environment and you want to control whether debug output is created by a setting
		in the main configuration file:<br>
		Setting the slot 'ShowDebugOutput' (in Config.any) to '1' will show the debug
		output, while setting it to '0' will switch it off.<br><br>
	</li>
	<li>Write a configuration Anything for the conditional Renderer and define the
		condition to be checked by the conditional Renderer and embed the
		previously defined Renderers into the newly created configuration data.<br>
		Sample:<br>
		Setup the configuration for a ConditionalRenderer and put the
		data in the Page.any configuration file. (You might just
		as well put it in the configuration file of a specific Page or
		the configuration file of a Role.):
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/ConditionalDebugOutput {"
		"	/Condition {"
		"		/ContextCondition	&#34;ShowDebugOutput&#34;"
		"		/True {"
		"			/Lookup {"
		"				/LookupName &#34;DebugOutput&#34;"
		"			}"
		"		}"
		"		/False {}		# do nothing.. this slot could be omitted.."
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		an aequivalent though more compact specification would be:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/ConditionalDebugOutput {"
		"	/Condition {"
		"		/ContextCondition	&#34;ShowDebugOutput&#34;"
		"		/True {"
		"			/HTML {"
		"				/Template {"
		"				&#34;Diagnostic Output:&lt;br>&#34;"
		"				&#34;[[&#35;wd Lookup myData&#93;&#93;&#34;"
		"			}"
		"		}"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Use the configuration you just created where you want the conditional
		output to be rendered.<br>
		Sample:<br>
		The Renderer configuration data for this ConditionalRenderer is
		now accessible in the Context under the name 'ConditionalDebugOutput'.
		In whatever HTML file you want to include the debug output you can
		therefore write:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"[[&#35;wd Lookup ConditionalDebugOutput&#93;&#93;"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Make sure the condition variable changes according to your needs. (
		e.g. programmatically, by user input, etc.)<br>
		Sample:<br>
		Finally you create the condition variable in Config.any:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/ShowDebugOutput	1"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		You are done.. now you can now enable/disable your debug output
		simply by setting /ShowDebugOutput in Config.any!<br>
		<i>(Any change in the configuration files will affect the output
		only after a restart of the application!)</i>
	</li>
</ol>
