<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>WebDisplay supports two mechanisms for localization:
<ol>
	<li>Localization of individual strings may be achieved by using a StringRenderer.
		By localizing individual strings StringRenderer offers a very fine level of
		granularity. The approach is generally taken if there is not too much text to be
		localized and the overall layout of the page stays the same no matter what the current
		language might be. (Examples of short strings that might be localized this way might
		be titles, labels, headings, etc.)<br><br>
	</li>
	<li>Whole Pages may be rendered language specific by using different HTML templates
		with the HTMLTemplateRenderer. This approach offers a more coarse level of
		granularity. It is usually used were the structure of a page depends very much
		on the chosen language. In those cases there is generally not enough common page
		structure that might be shared among different localized pages.<br><br>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several language related settings in the Config.any configuration file.
These define if and what localized versions are supported by the WebDisplay server. 
<h3>Preconditions</h3>
<p>It is assumed that the un-localized application already exists, i.e. all the
necessary configuration files for roles, pages etc. are completed.
<h3>Steps to do:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The first step to get language specific pages is to setup the localization
		related entries (Language, UseBrowserLang and LanguageKeyMap) in Config.any.<br>
		Example: Localization related settings in Config.any:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"# set the default language to &#34;E&#34; (English)"
		"/Language		E"
		" "
		"# enable the language settings of the clients browser"
		"/UseBrowserLang	1"
		" "
		"# mapping of browser settings to abbreviations of the supported languages"
		"# this server supports four languages: D, E, F, I (e.g. German, English, "
		"# French and Italien)"
		"/LanguageKeyMap {"
		"	/D	{ &#34;de&#34; &#34;de-CH&#34; &#34;de-DE&#34; &#34;de-AU&#34; }"
		"	/E	{ &#34;en&#34; &#34;en-GB&#34; &#34;en-US&#34; }"
		"	/F	{ &#34;fr&#34; &#34;fr-BE&#34; &#34;fr-CA&#34; &#34;fr-FR&#34; &#34;fr-CH&#34; }"
		"	/I	{ &#34;it&#34; }"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		Notice: In WebDisplay a language is typically identified by a short string. (In the
		above example the strings "D", "E", "F" and "I" were used as identifiers for
		German, English, French and Italian.) This identifier is used by WebDisplay to
		retrieve localized versions of strings and HTML templates.
		<p>All the localization related settings in Config.any are optional: 
		<ul>
			<li>The entry 'Language' statically defines the default language setting for the server. 
				If 'Language' is not defined in Config.any, "D" is assumed to be the default
				language.
			</li>
			<li>The entry 'UseBrowserLang' decides if the language may be chosen at runtime. If
				'UseBrowserLang' is set to 1 (TRUE) WebDisplay decides at runtime what language
				to use by evaluating the users browser settings. (The user may choose his
				preferred language in the WWW browser.)
			</li>
			<li>The settings in 'LanguageKeyMap' are then
				used to map browser language settings to the identifiers used by WebDisplay.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>Example:	
		<br>In the above example the default language was set to "E" (English).
		Evaluation of browser settings was enabled and a map for various
		browser settings was defined. (If a user has defined French to
		be the language of his choice, each of his requests will contain
		the browser setting "fr". Because of above 'LanguageKeyMap' each
		such request will cause WebDisplay to use its "F" localized version.<br><br>
	</li>
	<li>Localizing strings:<br><br>
		A given string may be localized by replacing the respective text with a call to
		a StringRenderer. (This indirection allows WebDisplay to render a language
		specific string.)<br>
		Example: The static text "Good day" is replaced by a call to a StringRenderer:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"&lt;td>Good day&lt;/td>"
		" "
		"becomes:"
		" "
		"  &lt;td>[[&#35;wd Lookup myString &#93;&#93;&lt;/td>"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		All that remains to be done is to define a respective renderer 
		specification for 'myString':
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/myString {"
		"	/String {"
		"		/F          &#34;Bonjour&#34;"
		"		/E          &#34;Good day&#34;"
		"		/CH         &#34;Gr&uuml;ezi&#34;"
		"		/Default    &#34;Guten Tag&#34;"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		<i><font size=-1>(<b>Notice:</b> The slot names for the different localized versions of a 
		text directly correspond to the language identifier used by WebDisplay.
		If the StringRenderer specification does not contain an entry for the
		current language identifier then the 'Default' entry is used. 
		A minimal specification for a String Renderer must always contain the 
		'Type' and the 'Default' slot.)</font></i>
		<p>Although the renderer specification of an individual StringRenderer may be placed
		in any configuration file, it is usually put in a separate file. (So as to collect
		all translated strings in one place.) In Config.any the entry 'StringFile' may 
		name a file where you want to keep your localized strings:<br>
		Example:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/StringFile		&#34;MyLocalizedStrings&#34;"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		You might now put the Renderer specification for 'myString' in the
		file 'MyLocalizedStrings.any':
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"# content of: MyLocalizedStrings.any"
		"{"
		"	/myString {"
		"		/String {"
		"			/F          &#34;Bonjour&#34;"
		"			/E          &#34;Good day&#34;"
		"			/CH         &#34;Gr&uuml;ezi&#34;"
		"			/Default    &#34;Guten Tag&#34;"
		"		}"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Localizing HTML template files:<br><br>
		The same language identifiers that are used to localize individual strings may also be 
		used to localize whole HTML templates.<br>
		Usually HTML templates are retrieved using the path defined by the Config.any 
		entry 'TemplateDir' below 'HTMLTemplateConfig'.<br>
		Example: All HTML templates are retrieved from config/HTMLTemplates:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/HTMLTemplateConfig {"
		"	/TemplateDir	&#34;config/HTMLTemplates&#34;"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		It is now possible to setup different sub-directories for localized versions
		of individual HTML templates. All the template files for one language go 
		into one directory.
		<p>To setup the different sub-directories add the 'LanguageDirMap' entry to
		Config.any below 'HTMLTemplateConfig'. The entry defines the mapping from different language identifiers
		to respective sub-directories in the 'TemplateDir'.<br>
		Example:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/HTMLTemplateConfig {"
		"	/LanguageDirMap {	# maps language key to localized template dir"
		"		/D				&#34;German_Templates&#34;"
		"		/E				&#34;English_Templates&#34;"
		"		/F				&#34;French_Templates&#34;"
		"		/I				&#34;Italian_Templates&#34;"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		The respective directory structure for the configuration files looks like this:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"config/"
		"	HTMLTemplates/"
		"		German_Templates/"
		"		English_Templates/"
		"		French_Templates/"
		"		Italian_Templates/"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		Usually all default HTML templates are placed in the main 'TemplateDir'. Files
		in the main 'TemplateDir' may be overridden for an individual language by placing
		a file with the same name in the respective localized sub-directory.
		<i><font size=-1>(<b>Notice:</b> Not all HTML templates need to be localized: If no localized version 
		exists, the default version from the main TemplateDir is always used.)</font></i>
		<p>Example: Page 'MyPage' is using the HTML template 'MyTemplate.html'. Due
		to a different screen layout special versions of 'MyTemplate.html' need
		to be used for the german and the english Version of 'MyPage'. All
		other languages are to use the default version of the file.
		<p>The directory structure for this application might look like this:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"config/"
		"	MyPage.any"
		"	HTMLTemplates/"
		"		MyTemplate.html"
		"		German_Templates/"
		"			MyTemplate.html"
		"		English_Templates/"
		"			MyTemplate.html"
		"		French_Templates/"
		"		Italian_Templates/"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
</ol>
