<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>There are many applications where the content of a page cannot be
statically defined but - since it depends on some mutable data - has 
to be determined at runtime (By querying a database, reading a file, 
using some proprietary middleware, etc. Examples might be current stock 
quotes, customer data like account statements, personal profiles etc.)

<p>This recipe explains what needs to be done to use dynamic data for the
rendition of some page content.

<p>There are basically three steps to be taken:
<ol>
	<li>Retrieval of the data that needs to be visualized, and transformation 
		of that data into an Anything representation:
		The concrete structure of the Anything depends on the Renderer to be 
		used for creating the final output (e.g. HTML). It may be 
		tailored to the needs of an existing Renderer. Alternatively a new
		Renderer may be created to handle any specialized Anything data structure.
	</li>
	<li>The Anything is then used as input for the rendering process by
		placing it - under a well known slot name - in the Context before any 
		rendering is started.
	</li>
	<li>The concrete Renderer to utilize the data needs to be configured properly - so
		as to find the data - and may then be used as a building block for the Page 
		that wants to dynamically create some content.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>(Caution: Once the data is in the Context, in principle any Renderer - that 
wishes to do so - may use it to create some output. This implies that it is 
the responsibility of the application to avoid possible conflicts - e.g. 
corruption of data that is used by multiple Renderers.)
<h3>Preconditions</h3>
<p>In the following example the page Ex4Page (which is a sub-page of Page) is to 
display some dynamic output, i.e. the current date. Initially  Ex4Page simply 
displays the static HTML template Ex4Page.html. The action that leads to 
Ex4Page is GoExample4. It is assumed that all the respective configuration data is 
setup properly - i.e. no C++ code was yet written but the configuration files 
contain something like this:<br>
<p>Config.any:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/Roles {"
		"	/Role {"
		"		&#34;Default&#34;"
		"	}"
		"}"
		" "
		"/Pages {"
		"	# subclasses for &#34;Page&#34;"
		"	&#34;Ex4Page&#34;"
		"	..."
		"}"
		" "
	}
}]]
</pre>
<p>Role.any:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/Map {"
		"	/Default {"
		"		/GoExample4 &#34;Ex4Page&#34;"
		"		..."
		"	}"
		"}"
		" "
	}
}]]
</pre>
<p>Ex4Page.any:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/PageLayout {"
		"	/HTML {"
		"		/TemplateName &#34;Ex4Page&#34;"
		"	}"
		"}"
		" "
	}
}]]
</pre>
<p>Ex4Page.html:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"...."
		"(the current time should go here)"
		"..."
	}
}]]
</pre>
<h3>Steps to do:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A string containing the current date is easily created by the following
		C++ code:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"time_t now;"
		"time(&now);"
		"struct tm res;"
		"struct tm *tt= localtime_r(&now, &res);"
		" "
		"char date[200];"
		"strftime(date, 100, &#34;%C&#34;, tt);"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		Putting the date into an Anything is straight forward too:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"Anything anyDate= Anything(date);"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		(The example is deliberately kept very simple. However a real application
		might retrieve some arbitrary data at this point -  e.g. using a database.)<br><br>
	</li>
	<li>The Anything created in step 1 is now typically placed in the 
		AppTmpStore for later processing by the Renderers. In this example the
		data is put at slot 'currentDate'. <br>
		(Eventhough the data may - in principle - be placed anywhere in the 
		Context, AppTmpStore is the right choice when it comes to data that is 
		used for one particular request only. An empty AppTmpStore is used for 
		each new request and it is discarded after the request is processed, i.e. 
		it acts as a scratch pad.) 
		<p>The question that needs to be answered now is were exactly to place 
		the C++ code shown above. There are two alternatives:
		<ul>
			<li>The code may be tied to the Action leading to the Page on which the 
				data should be used, i.e. we write some C++ code for GoExample4. The code that
				modifies the AppTmpStore is then placed in the respective DoAction() method:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"class GoExample4 : public Action {"
		"public:"
		"	GoExample4() {}"
		"	bool DoAction(String &action, Context &c);"
		"};"
		" "
		"RegisterAction(GoExample4);"
		" "
		"bool GoExample4::DoAction(String &action, Context &c)"
		"{"
		"	Anything tmpStore= c.GetTmpStore();"
		" "
		"	time_t now;"
		"	time(&now);"
		"	struct tm res;"
		"	struct tm *tt= localtime_r(&now, &res);"
		" "
		"	char date[200];"
		"	strftime(date, 100, &#34;%C&#34;, tt);"
		" "
		"	tmpStore[&#34;currentDate&#34;]= date;"
		" "
		"	return true;"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>The alternative is to create C++ code for the Page (or one of its super-
				pages) that wants to use the data, e.g. Ex4Page. The code that modifies the 
				AppTmpStore is then placed in the respective Preprocess() method:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"class Ex4Page : public Page {"
		"public:"
		"	Ex4Page();"
		"	Ex4Page(const char *title);"
		" "
		"	virtual void Preprocess(Context &c);"
		"	IFAObject *Clone() const;"
		"};"
		" "
		"RegisterPage(Ex4Page);"
		"Ex4Page::Ex4Page() : Page(&#34;Ex4Page&#34;) {}"
		" "
		"IFAObject *Ex4Page::Clone() const"
		"{"
		"	return new Ex4Page;"
		"}"
		" "
		"void Ex4Page::Preprocess(Context &c)"
		"{"
		"	Anything tmpStore= c.GetTmpStore();"
		" "
		"	time_t now;"
		"	time(&now);"
		"	struct tm res;"
		"	struct tm *tt= localtime_r(&now, &res);"
		" "
		"	char date[200];"
		"	strftime(date, 100, &#34;%C&#34;, tt);"
		" "
		"	tmpStore[&#34;currentDate&#34;]= date;"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
			</li>
		</ul>
		Whether we create code for the Action::DoAction() or the Page::Preprocess()
		the AppTmpStore is modified before any rendering takes place!<br><br>
	</li>
	<li>Whenever page Ex4Page is now reached (in the first case via GoExample4) we can safely assume
		that slot 'currentDate' in AppTmpStore contains a string with the
		current date. We may therefore use a simple ContextLookupRenderer to 
		lookup and display that string:<br>
		Ex4Page.html:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"..."
		"[[&#35;wd Lookup currentDate &#93;&#93;"
		"..."
	}
}]]
</pre>
		More complex Renderers may require more configuration data than just a single
		slot-name like 'currentDate'. The Renderer specification is then conveniantly 
		put in the configuration file of the page and is rendered indirectly into 
		the HTML template:<br>
		Ex4Page.any:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"..."
		"/ArbitraryRendererSpec {"
		"	/Lookup {"
		"		/ContextLookupName	&#34;currentDate&#34;"
		"	}"
		"}"
		"..."
	}
}]]
</pre>
		Ex4Page.html:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"...."
		"[[&#35;wd Lookup ArbitraryRendererSpec &#93;&#93;"
		"..."
	}
}]]
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
