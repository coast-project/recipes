<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ContextLookupRenderer (alias name 'Lookup') is one of the Renderers 
predefined by the Coast framework. This recipe explains when
a ContextLookupRenderer might be handy and how it is used.
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>It is possible to call different sorts of Renderers directly from any 
HTML-template, and thereby to dynamically create some page content. 
Such direct calls typically contain the name of the Renderer to 
be used as well as the parameters required for that Renderer. 
<p>Unfortunately a direct call basically hard codes the Renderer to be 
used into the HTML-template. There are two flaws with this approach:
<ol>
	<li>You might be in a situation where your HTML-template could be readily
		used for different pages if only that part created by the Renderer
		changed depending on the context. However since it is hard coded into
		the HTML-template the Renderer cannot be easily exchanged.  
	</li>
	<li>The same Renderer used for one page might be useful on different 
		other pages as well. Now instead of copying the same code to all 
		those pages, would it not be much better to define a building
		block that could then be used on all those occasions?
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>As its name suggests a ContextLookupRenderer adds a level of indirection
to the rendering process: The ContextLookupRenderer uses a symbolic name
to dynamically locate a Renderer specification (including a Renderer name
and respective parameters) in the current context. It then triggers 
execution of that Renderer. (When searching a Renderer specification in
the current Context different stores contained in the Context are
considered: 1.TmpStore, 2.RoleStore, 3.SessionStore, 4. configuration data
of the current Page, 5. configuration data of the current Role.) 
<p>A ContextLookupRenderer thereby solves the two problems mentioned initially:
<ol>
	<li>The Renderer that is actually found and used may now depend on the 
		current Context: Say you're using the symbolic name 'MyRenderer' 
		as an argument for ContextLookupRenderer. By defining 'MyRenderer' 
		differently in the configuration files of several Pages, you might
		still reuse the layout defined once in an HTML-template.
	</li>
	<li>A ContextLookupRenderer allows you to invoke Renderer specifications
		that are defined anywhere in the Context (e.g. some Page/Role 
		configuration file). The same building block may be reused
		in different places.
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Preconditions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>You need the Page - i.e. the respective Page configuration file - where
		you want to use the Renderer.
	</li>
	<li>A ContextLookupRenderer expects to find a valid Renderer specification
		- or nothing at all - under the slotname that it was given as an 
		argument. (If nothing is found in the Context ContextLookupRenderer 
		degenerates to a 'nop') Usually the referenced Renderer specification
		is defined in a configuration file (e.g. XxxRole.any or XxxPage.any)
	</li>
	<li>If you want to use ContextLookupRenderer by an alias name (e.g. Lookup) be
		sure to include that name in the Renderers section of Config.any:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/Renderers {"
		"	/ContextLookupRenderer { Lookup }"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Steps to do:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>It is usually a good idea to do a bit of planning before
		rushing to the code writing part. Find - at least - answers to the 
		following questions:
		<p>- What is the structure of the pages I am trying to set up? 
		<br>- Which parts do I wish to reuse as building blocks for pages? 
		<br>- Which parts need to change under what circumstances?<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Example 1:<br>
				The first example demonstrates how a ContextLookupRenderer is used
				to refer to a Renderer specification which is defined in the Page's 
				configuration file:<br>
				Say you've got a page XPage that displays the HTML-template 
				XPageTemplate.html and that's already all for step one.
			</li>
			<li>Example 2:<br>
				You're having a page XPage and you're using XPageTemplate.html
				as a template for the general layout of that page. 
				You've also got the two roles Guest and Customer in your system.
				Now say you want XPage to always reflect to fact what role a user 
				is in by either rendering the text 'Guest' or 'Customer'.<br><br>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>According to your findings - regarding those questions - define Renderer 
		specification(s) in the Context (This is typically done by placing
		the Renderer specification in some configuration file. Eventhough it 
		is of course possible to add a specification programmatically at 
		runtime.. say by placing it in the TmpStore).<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Example 1:<br>
				In the XPage's configuration file XPage.any the building
				block 'MyBuildingBlock' is created. (This is then used by 
				HTML-template.) 
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/MyBuildingBlock {"
		"	/String {"
		"		/Default &#34;Hello World&#34;"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Example 2:<br>
				You define Renderer specifications for the two strings - since
				their use depends exclusively on the current role - and place them 
				in the respective Guest.any and Customer.any configuration files
				(it is assumed that those files already exist):
				<p>in Guest.any you put the Renderer specification:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/DynamicText {"
		"	/String {"
		"		/Default &#34;Guest&#34;"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
				in Customer.any you put the Renderer specification:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/DynamicText {"
		"	/String {"
		"		/Default &#34;Customer&#34;"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
				(Depending on the current Context - i.e. what role a user is in -
				a lookup of the name 'DynamicText' will now return one or the other
				Renderer specification!)			
			</li>
		</ul><br>
	</li>
	<li>Include a ContextLookupRenderer that references the Renderer specification 
		in some HTML-template.
		<ul>
			<li>Example 1:<br>
				Wherever you want to have the string 'hello world' rendered, you include a 
				call to ContextLookupRenderer (with the parameter 'MyBuildingBlock') in 
				your XPageTemplate.html file:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"[[&#35;wd Lookup MyBuildingBlock &#93;&#93;"
	}
}]]
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Example 2:<br>
				Wherever you want to have the string rendered, you include a 
				call to ContextLookupRenderer (with the parameter 'DynamicText') in 
				your XPageTemplate.html file and you will get 'Customer' or 'Guest':
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"[[&#35;wd Lookup DynamicText &#93;&#93;"
	}
}]]
</pre>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
