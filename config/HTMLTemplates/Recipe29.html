<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This recipe discusses the issues in deciding whether to reuse existing
renderers or to introduce a new one. Since this is not a question where
you can decide on hard facts it also involves taste and is ultimately
based on good judgement.
<p>In the following we try to outline the basic line of thoughts you should
consider when you have to decide about a new class. 
<h3>Preconditions</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You have a basic understanding of the concepts and classes of Coast.</li>
	<li>You have a deeper knowledge of existing Renderers and their capabilities.</li>
	<li>You have analyzed the requirements for the needed component and have
		a clear idea of the functionality and the presentation of the wanted part.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps to do:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>First of all: <b>Try to reuse existing renderers</b>, that's why they're here!!
		<p>So based on your knowledge, go through the list of the existing
		renderers and try them out. Maybe you don't know all that deep or you can
		combine several toghether to achieve the functionality and presentation
		you wish.
		<p><b>Caveat:</b> With HTML-Templates you can virtually do everything needed, but
		it is not always the most performant solution. HTML-Templates are great
		in defining layouts (fixed tables) or in providing some snippets with
		dynamic data.
		<p>Beware of flag setting mania, too much conditional rendering is as bad
		as too much conditional code. Try to use polymorphism instead. Thats why
		the page configurations have some sort of inheritance.
		<p>There are several results possible regarding your first step.
		<ul>
			<li>You found something simple you're completely satisfied with.
				<br>Congratulations you're done and you reused a given object! (best case)<br>
				Sample:
<pre>
HTML-Template for Layout
Image Buttons, Anchors and fields with dynamic content
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>You found something that's not simple (in terms of configuration) but
				fullfills your requirement. Depending on the performance of your
				construct or maintainability you have to reconsider your solution.<br>
				Sample:
<pre>
Dynamic Table with HTML-Templates and dynamic content
Most templates contain conditional renderers triggered by flags
that must be maintained by your code.
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>You found nothing that can serve your purpose. So you have to build something new.
			</li>
		</ul><br><br>
	</li>
	<li>If the result of your second step is that you have to build something
		new, then you have to decide several things:<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Should the renderer be reusable or special purpose?<br>
				If you build something new for your special purposes, be
				aware, if the same situation arrives several times, that you have to
				generalize your design to make it reusable.<br>&nbsp;
			</li>
			<li>What kind of role does it play?<br>
				Arrange layouts, some sort of box or a fancy new widget
				with special bookkeeping<br><br>
			</li>
			<li>How is it configured?<br>
				Define the needed options that have to be configured. Since it is a new
				thing you can design to your needs. But be aware, that you still can
				exploit the existing renderers by having attributes that are themselves
				renderer specifications. If the need arrives you can easily support
				extensions of your renderer by calling Renderer::ContextLookup with
				specifications you don't know in your Renderer-Code.<br><br>
			</li>
			<li>What kind of data does it need that have to be rendered?<br>
				Try to configure your needed data access, so you can easily adapt to
				new data configurations. If you're not absolutely sure (and you'll never
				be) it's a one shot DON'T HARDCODE your data access paths into you're 
				rendering code.<br><br>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The technical implementation of a new Renderer is quite simple. You
		have to derive a subclass of Renderer. You have to implement the Method
		RenderAll and call the Macro RegisterRenderer('ClassName'). <br>
		If you want to use the new Renderer with an alias, you can define one
		in the Config.any file of the Server.<br>
		Sample:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"class MyNewRenderer : public Renderer {"
		"public:"
		"	MyNewRenderer(const char *name);"
		"	~MyNewRenderer();"
		" "
		"	virtual void RenderAll(ostream &reply, Context &c, const ROAnything &config);"
		"};"
		" "
		"//---- MyNewRenderer ----------------------------------------------------------------"
		" "
		"RegisterRenderer(MyNewRenderer);"
		" "
		"MyNewRenderer::MyNewRenderer(const char *name) : Renderer(name) { }"
		" "
		"MyNewRenderer::~MyNewRenderer() { }"
		" "
		"void MyNewRenderer::RenderAll(ostream &reply, Context &c, const ROAnything &config)"
		"{"
		"	StartTrace(MyNewRenderer.RenderAll);"
		"	// do some fancy stuff here"
		"	..."
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
</ol>
