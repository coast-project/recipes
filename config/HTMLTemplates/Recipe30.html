<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Usually new Pages are derived from existing ones by configuration -
i.e. without writing any C++ code. However simple configuration may
not work for all cases. Therefore you can always add code for any Page by 
writing a respective C++ class (as a subclass of Page). 
<p>And there are several sound reasons why to write code for a new Page...
<h3>Preconditions</h3>
<p>All the usual configuration settings are needed whether C++ code for a
Page is added or not, i.e. C++ code for a Page may be easily added after
the general application structure (Roles, Pages, etc) has been setup.
<p><i><font size=-1><b>Reminders:</b> You need to register any Page that you want to use in the UI 
of your application in the Pages section of Config.any.</font></i>
<p>If the Page is to be used directly, there must be a respective 
configuration file 'ExamplePage.any' (unless your page does without any configuration):
<h3>Steps to do:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Create the necessary configuration files (see as well other recipes):<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Entry in Config.any</li>
			<li>Entries in state transition tables of affected Roles (Map)</li>
			<li>Respective Page configuration file</li><br><br>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Create a new class by subclassing Page (or one of its descendants):
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"class MyNewPage : public Page {"
		"public:"
		"	MyNewPage();"
		"	IFAObject *Clone() const;"
		"};"
		" "
		" "
		"RegisterPage(MyNewPage);"
		" "
		"MyNewPage::MyNewPage() : Page(&#34;MyNewPage&#34;)"
		"{"
		"}"
		" "
		"IFAObject *MyNewPage::Clone() const"
		"{"
		"	// The New() method needs to be overridden so that other"
		"	// Pages - that might be derived from MyNewPage purely by"
		"	// configuration - can share the code of MyNewPage"
		" "
		"	return new MyNewPage;"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		<i><font size=-1><b>Caution:</b> The C++ code for a Page is always registered with the name of 
		the class (using the RegisterPage macro in the *.cpp file):</font></i>
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"RegisterPage(MyNewPage);"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		Whereas the name defined in the Page's C++ class default constructor defines 
		the name that is used for identifying the Page at runtime and for retrieving 
		the Page's configuration file. To work properly, the name used in the default 
		constructor MUST match the name of the Page class:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"MyNewPage::MyNewPage() : Page(&#34;MyNewPage&#34;)"
		"{"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Add the methods that you want to override:<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>The single most important reason for writing code for a new Page is
				the desire to do some processing before a Page is actually rendered, i.e.
				the context for the rendering process needs first to be setup properly
				by some C++ code. (For example the data that you want to display on the 
				page might reside in a database and needs first to be retrieved etc.) 
				<p>You place all the code that you need to have executed - before a Page
				is rendered - in the method Preprocess() of the derived Page C++ class.<br>
				Example:<br>
				You want to prepare some data first (see [[#wd Lookup Recipe25 ]]).
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"void MyNewPage::Preprocess(Context &c)"
		"{"
		"	Anything tmpStore   = c.GetTmpStore();"
		" "
		"	// put the necessary data in TmpStore"
		"	// e.g. :	tmpStore[&#34;MyData&#34;]= ...."
		" "
		"	Page::Preprocess(c);"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>A second reason to write some C++ code is that you might need to have 
				some code executed whenever the user leaves a Page (you might want to 
				evaluate the state of the UI settings, etc.), i.e. the user requests the 
				next Page and thereby implicitely leaves the previous one. Due to the 
				possibility that the user has been using the 'Back' button of his browser, 
				any Page may be re-posted. 
				<p>Code that is executed whenever a Page is left is placed in the method 
				Postprocess().<br>
				Example:<br>
				HTML toggle buttons are a bit tricky, in that unset fields
				are never reported by the browser.. this may be remedied<br>
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"bool MyNewPage::Postprocess(String &action, Context &c)"
		"{"
		"	// whenever the user leaves MyPage - by following some"
		"	// link/button - this code is executed:"
		" "
		"	// ...this might be used to synchronize UI settings etc."
		" "
		"	Anything query= c.GetQuery();"
		" "
		"	if (query.IsDefined(&#34;fields&#34;)) {"
		"		Anything fields= query[&#34;fields&#34;];"
		" "
		"		if (!fields.IsDefined(&#34;myToggle&#34;))"
		"			fields[&#34;myToggle&#34;]= &#34;off&#34;;"
		"	}"
		"	return Page::Postprocess(action, c); "
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Per default Page assumes that HTML code is created as output and therefore 
				automatically sets the content mime type to "text/html". However Pages with 
				contents other than HTML may be created by overriding the method Mime().<br>
				(For example PDF documents might be generated by setting the mime type 
				of the respective Pages to "application/pdf".)<br>
				Example:<br>
				You want a page that creates PDF files (you'll probably need some Renderers too)<br>
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"void MyNewPage::Mime(Reply &reply, Context&)"
		"{"
		"	reply.AppendHeader(&#34;Content-type: application/pdf\n&#34;);"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>The default implementation of Page supports two strategies for 
				defining the content of a Page:<br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>One global "PageLayout" - that needs to be defined in the respective 
						Page configuration file - is used. Using this strategy any combination
						of Renderers may be used to render the Page.<br><br>
					</li>
					<li>The stucture of the Page is devided into different sections that may
						then be defined separately: Header, Title, Body, Footer. Clearly this
						strategy only works if your Page also fits this given structure.<br><br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		By overriding either Render() or one of the minor methods Header(), Title(), 
		Body(), Footer() the general rendering strategy of a Page may be modified.
	</li>
</ol>
