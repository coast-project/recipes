<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Form- and FieldRenderer allows you to create HTML forms to gather user input.<br>
The FormRenderer let you specify the action, that should be triggered
on submitting the form.
<p>A subclass of the Action class can be used, by overwriting the DoAction
method, to handle the user input.
<p>The user input can be accessed through the Contexts "Query" item, which
itself contains a "fields" item storing all the fields and their values.
<h3>Preconditions</h3>
<ul>
	<li>FormRenderer and FieldRenderer are defined in config.any and aliased to Form and Field.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps to do:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Define a FormRenderer, which holds all the needed fields and launches
		the action, that will handle the input. And include it in the Body part
		of the page, that is going to hold it.<br>
		The Renderer specification for a FormRenderer looks as follows:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/MyForm {"
		"	/Form {"
		"		/Method &#34;GET&#34;"
		"		/Action &#34;MyFormAction&#34;"
		"		/Template {"
		"			&#34;My first field :[[ &#35;wd Lookup MyFirstField &#93;&#93;&#34;"
		"			&#34;&lt;p>My second field :[[ &#35;wd Lookup MySecondField &#93;&#93;&#34;"
		"			&#34;[[ &#35;wd Lookup MyButton &#93;&#93;&#34;"
		"			..."
		"		}"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		Short description of the items :<br>
		<tt>/Method</tt>: 
		<ol>
			GET or POST, is directly mapped to to the HTML FORM tag attribute METHOD.
		</ol>
		<tt>/Action</tt>:
		<ol>The Action, that should be triggered by WebDisplay. It has to be an action
			name that is defined in the Actions section of the config.any file. (see
			step 4) Attention this is NOT directly correlated to the HTML FORM tag
			attribut ACTION, but it is used to generate the proper link, which then
			is used as ACTION attribute.
		</ol>
		<tt>/Template</tt>:
		<ol>Specifies the body of the FORM tag analogous to the HTMLTemplateRenderer.
			It has to contain all the Fields, that belong to the form. As you can see
			the preferred method is by including each field as ContextLookupRenderer specification.
		</ol>
		<tt>/TemplateName</tt>:
		<ol>Can be used alternativly to the /Template item to specify a file, that
			contains the HTML body. See also HTMLTemplaterenderer.
		</ol><br><br>
	</li>
	<li>Specify the different FieldRenderers used in the body template of the FormRenderer.<br>
		Staying with the example above, this would look like this:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/MyButton {"
		"	/Button {"
		"		/Name &#34;MyButton&#34;"
		"		/Label {"
		"			/String {"
		"				/Default &#34;Press Me&#34;"
		"			}"
		"		}"
		"	}"
		"}"
		" "
		"/MyFirstField {"
		"	/Text {"
		"		/Name  &#34;MyFirstField&#34;"
		"		/Value &#34;Default&#34;"
		"		/Size  32"
		"	}"
		"}"
		" "
		"/MySecondField {"
		"	/CheckBox {"
		"		/Name    &#34;MySecondField&#34;"
		"		/Checked &#34;on&#34;"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		For a close look to the FieldRenderer specification please refer to the
		appropriate documentation (or to the source code while the docu isn't available).<br><br>
	</li>
	<li>Write a new subclass of the class Action.
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"class MyFormAction : public Action"
		"{"
		"	public:"
		"		MyFormAction() {};"
		"		virtual ~MyFormAction() {};"
		"		virtual bool DoAction(String &action, Context &c);"
		"};"
		" "
		"RegisterAction(MyFormAction); // Add the Action to the registry"
		" "
		"// You only have to overwrite the DoAction method:"
		" "
		"bool MyFormAction::DoAction(String &amp;name, Context &amp;c)"
		"{"
		"	Anything query = c.GetQuery();"
		"	Anything fields = query[&#34;fields&#34;];"
		"	"
		"	// Using the example above fields will look like this"
		"	// /MyButton &#34;Press Me&#34;"
		"	// /MyFirstField &#34;Whatever has been enterd in this field&#34;"
		"	// /MySecondField &#34;on&#34; only if checked else it isn't there"
		"	"
		"	// code to handle the input"
		"	StoreFieldsInFile();"
		"	if (fields.IsDefined(&#34;MySecondField&#34;) {"
		"		SendEMail();"
		"	}"
		"	... etc"
		"	action = &#34;MyFormAction&#34;;"
		"	return true;"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		Remember that DoAction has to return the name of an "? action ?", that is defined in
		/Map and will be used to find the next page.<br><br>
	</li>
	<li>Define the Action in the config.any file. Add an alias, which can be used in the
		Renderer specifications, to the /Actions item:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/Actions {"
		"	/MyFormAction {"
		"		&#34;MyForm&#34;"
		"	}"
		"	... other Actions"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
</ol>
