<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>One of the main advantages using Coast is that it support roles in 
a highly flexible manner. This let you define exactly which user may 
access which pages. Because Coast also provides a session mechanism the 
user can login once and all his privileges are granted from then on.
<h3>Preconditions</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Setup of the Pages to be used by the application is done.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps to do:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Define the roles and their hierarchy.<br>
		Within Config.any there must be a /Roles tag:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/Roles {"
		"	/Role {"
		"		&#34;Default&#34;"
		"	}"
		"}"
		" "
		"or another one"
		" "
		"/Roles {"
		"	/Role { &#34;Admin&#34; &#34;Guest&#34; &#34;Customer&#34; }"
		"	/Guest { &#34;Default&#34; }"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		All the Roles must be defined there. You may also specify a Default role
		but this is not implemented properly by now.<br>
		Another important tag is /RoleChanges:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/RoleChanges {"
		"	/GoAdmin     &#34;Admin&#34;"
		"	/GoCustomer  &#34;Customer&#34;"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		This defines actions that forces the role to be changed (Use a 
		overwritten 'DoAction' to launch the appropriate Action - see [[#wd Lookup Recipe9 ]] ).. <br>
		Define the user levels in the Role.any file:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/GuestRole     0"
		"/CustomerRole  1"
		"/AdminRole     2"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		This defines the hierarchy AdminRole > CustomerRole > GuestRole.<br>
		Remember the higher roles have all the privileges of the roles with a lower level.<br><br>
	</li>
	<li>Configure the Maps for the different roles.<br>
		For each role create a "RoleName".any configuration file, where you can define
		the role specific navigation maps (Refer to [[#wd Lookup Recipe1 ]] for a description).<br><br>
	</li>
	<li>Create the subclasses for the different roles.<br>
		Until now you have to create a new subclass of Role for each different
		role (this will change in the future, such that you can have different
		roles instanciatied from the same class).<br>
		The most important method to overwrite is the Constructor because
		it is there where the name is set properly:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"MyNewRole::MyNewRole() : Role(&#34;MyNewRole&#34;)"
		"{}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		There are three interesting methods more which may be overwritten.
		They allow you to implement specific security checks.
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"// Resolve the name for the next page with currentpage and action."
		"// The default implementation uses a table driven"
		"// approach. The table is usually defined in [RoleName].any"
		" "
		"virtual bool DoGetNewPageName( Context &c, String &transition, String& pagename );"
		" "
		"// checks role levels by name according to role precedence defined in Role.any"
		"// GuestRole &#60; CustomerRole &#60; AnotherRole"
		" "
		"virtual bool CheckLevel(const char *name) const;"
		" "
		"// verifies query params default implementation"
		"// does nothing"
		"virtual bool DoVerify(Context &,String &,String &);"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
</ol>
