<h3>Short description of COAST</h3>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>COAST is a platform for developing and deploying World Wide Web applications.
For development, it provides a framework, reusable components, and a configuration 
mechanism that is used to create web applications. For deployment, it provides 
an efficient and scaleable server and additional flexible communication infrastructure.
<h4>Motivation and Highlights</h4>
<p>Implementing World Wide Web applications typically centers around writing 
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs for an HTTP server. As long as these 
web applications are not too sophisticated simple implementation in Perl or Python 
suffices. If a web application has to maintain the notion of a session, that is 
keeping state across multiple pages, the naive CGI approach is getting cumbersome 
because HTTP servers and the CGI mechanism has no simple means for maintaining state.
Keeping state in files within the filesystem is slow and doesn't scale very well.
In addition since http servers typically call CGIs concurrently 
appropriate file locking has to take place.
<p>The design and implementation of COAST started out as an attempt to solve 
the problem of maintaining state within a session in an efficient and scaleable way. 
The underlying architecture was based on the concept of a server framework. 
The basic server receives requests for pages from an associated http server. 
In order to handle a request a developer has to override a single method. 
Because the method belongs to an object that can be preserved across requests 
it is simple to keep state across requests too.
<h4>Steps to perform for developing a new COAST application</h4>
<ol>
	<li>You need a concept for your target system e.g.
		<ul>
			<li>what you would like to show on the customers browser</li>
			<li>what kind of data you will need and how you can get them</li>
			<li>are there any security requirements</li>
			<li>what is the general layout</li>
			<li><br>and so forth</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Then you must match your requests to the structure COAST is offering. That means 
		<ul>
			<li>you have to know what COAST is supposed to be 
				<br>(see
				<a href='[[#wd Lookup COASTDocuIndex ]]' target=_blank>COAST Class-Index</a>
				 and of course [[#wd Lookup RecipesListPage ]] )</li>
			<li>keep in mind, that with COAST you can configure a lot without writing any code</li>
			<li>think about the hierarchical structure and what parts are used again and again
				<br>and so on</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Now set up your developing environment (see <a href="[[#wd Lookup PageURL ]]#StartWD">Starting a new COAST application</a>)
		<br>&nbsp;</li> 
	<li>Go on adding the necessary configuration files and writing some code (e.g. for the back end)
		<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Test your application using the configurable trace and debug output (see <a href="[[#wd Lookup PageURL ]]#DebugWD">How to Debug</a> )
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Starting a new COAST application</h3>
<ul>
	<li><h4>Preconditions:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Developing System e.g. UNIX with SNiFF+ and Compiler g++</li>
			<li>Browser like Netscape Navigator</li>
			<li>At last you need the source of the framework COAST and for an easy start a sample application like 'Hello World'</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><h4>Steps to do:</h4>
		<ul><li>Copy the COAST framework in one Directory and the small 'Hello World' project in a different directory
		</li><li>Setup your project with SNiFF+
		</li><li>Change the sample configuration files (at least config.any, page.any, role.any) to fit your needs
		</li><li>Generate the application using the existing makefiles
		</li><li>Start your application with the shellscript: <tt>startwda.sh</tt>
			<br>Start your browser and enter the following (to your environment adapted) URL:
			<br><i>'http://[[#wd Lookup header.HOST ]]/'</i>
		</li><li>Hopefully you will get now your first page. 
			<br><i>(If not, you just started to develop and debug your own COAST application.)</i>
		</li></ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>What COAST is made of</h3>
<p>The COAST framework consists of the following C++ classes:
<p><a href='[[#wd Lookup COASTDocuIndex ]]' target=_blank>COAST Class-Index</a>
<p>Furthermore there are some predefined make files to create a linkable library. These makefiles
are updated automatically supported by Sniff+.
<p>By the way, COAST can be generated for SunOS5.[678], Linux >= 2.1.2 and Win32!
<p>In order to get a running application one has to add some mandatory configuration files 
<br><i>(Add this files in a different directory structure than the COAST sources)</i>:
<table border=1 bgcolor=#DFFEFE>
<tr valign=top>
	<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Config.any</li>
			<li>Dbg.any</li>
			<li>'YourFirst'Page.any</li>
			<li>Page.any</li>
			<li>Role.any</li>
			<li>Server.any</li>
		</ul>
	</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>For example in our Hello World Project there are the following files:
<table border=1 width=100%>
	<tr Valign=TOP>
		<th width=25%>In subdirectory <br>'helloworld_src'</th>
		<th width=25%>In subdirectory <br>'config'</th>
		<th width=25%>In subdirectory <br>'config/HTMLTemplates'</th>
		<th width=25%>In subdirectory <br>'config/HTMLTemplates/static/images'</th>
	</tr><tr valign=top>
		<td width=25%>
			HelloWorldActions.cpp
			<br>HelloWorldActions.h
		</td><td width=25%>
			Config.any
			<br>Dbg.any
			<br>HelloWorldPage.any
			<br>OutputMapperMeta.any
			<br>Page.any
			<br>PicturePage.any
			<br>Role.any
			<br>Server.any
		</td><td width=25%>
			HelloWorldPage.html
			<br>PicturePage.html
			<br>SharedPageLayout.html
		</td><td width=25%>
			somelogo_big.gif
			<br>somelogo_small.gif
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>How to Debug</h3>
<ol>
	<li><h4>Trace output on cerr:</h4>
		For debugging purposes there are a Tracer class and macros. 
		This macros help keep the coding expense
		for inserting trace statements into the source-code at a minimum.
		If the preprocessor flag DEBUG is not set they expand into nothing.
		To keep the trace output at acceptable levels we introduced a config
		file for debugging Dbg.any. Therein you can switch the trace on and off.<br>
		At the top of Dbg.any you can set some general switches:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/LowerBound        10      # 0 => no debug output"
		"/UpperBound        120     # "
		"/DumpAnythings     1       # print full Anythings"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		Trace statements are scoped. In every scope of a C++-Program you can
		use a StartTrace or StartTrace1 macro. They take as a first parameter
		a trigger e.g. StartTrace(Server.Load). This results into output onto
		cerr like <tt>Server.Load: --- entering ---</tt> and
		<tt>Server.Load: --- leaving ---</tt>
		on entering resp. leaving the scope. Within the scope you can use as many
		Trace macros as you need. They are all set with the same switch.
		To set the switch you have to insert the following lines into Dbg.any
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/Server {"
		"	/MainSwitch     40"
		"	/EnableAll      50"
		"	/Load           45"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
		The keyword <tt>MainSwitch</tt> enable or disable the output from
		all those traces which start with "Server". The keyword <tt>EnableAll</tt>
		overrides the specific switches (e.g. Load).
		See as well Dbg.cpp or rather Dbg.h and Dbg.any.
	</li>
	<li><h4>Debug output at the end of each HTML-Page:</h4>
		<p>If the flag DEBUG is set, some information about session, stores and so forth 
		are always rendered into the reply in 'Context::HTMLDebugStores'. So you can check the actual 
		context from which the shown HTML-Page depends at the end of the page itself.
		<br>(Have a brief look at the end of this page.)
	</li>
	<li><h4>Additional Debug Information:</h4>
		<p>See [[#wd Lookup Recipe22 ]] for adding additional Debug output, but be aware that 
		there you make a change to the framework.
	</li>
	<li><h4>Native Debug Output</h4>
		<p>With some environment settings you have the possibility to get more information about
		the inner work from COAST.<br>
		The values of <tt>WD_LOGONCERR</tt> and <tt>WD_DOLOG</tt> control the level of severities 
		shown either on the console or in the syslog.<br>Possible values are:
<pre>
  1: DEBUG
  2: INFO
  3: WARNING
  4: ERROR
  5: ALERT
</pre>
		The flag <tt>TRACE_STATICALLOC</tt> shows you the allocation and deletion of
		all statically allocated objects used in COAST.
	</li>

<h3>Architecture of renderer specifications</h3>
<p>In order to let the COAST know which renderer to use now and what data to overgive,
a renderer specification is needed. It's obvious that the renderer specification 
is described in an anything format and it has the following principle structure:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"{"
		"	/'renderername' {"
		"		/'moreInfosForThisRenderer'"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
<p>With 'name' this individual renderer specification will be found; 
<br>Under the key <font color=#FF0000>Type</font> you specify which renderer is meant;
<br>Under the key <font color=#FF0000>Data</font> some Parameters for this renderer can be configured and 
therefore this deeper structure depends on each given renderer type;
<p>Samples:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/AnElementOfForm {"
		"	/TextField {		# 'TextField' is an alias for TextFieldRenderer (see Config.any)"
		"		/Name	username"
		"		/Value	UserNameField"
		"		/Size	32"
		"	}"
		"}"
		" "
		"/MyBuildingBlock {"
		"	/String {			# 'String' is an alias for StringRenderer (see config.any)"
		"		/Default	&#34;Hello World&#34;"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
<p>The <b>HTMLTemplateRenderer</b> is a tiny bit especial, because you can either define 
the whole specification in the *.any file or you can refer to a HTML Template file.

<ul>
	<li>Complete renderer specification in a *.any file:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/MyKey {"
		"	/HTML {"
		"		/Template {"
		"			&#34;&lt;center>&lt;h4>This is something &lt;/h4>&lt;/center>&lt;hr>&#34;"
		"			&#34;[[&#35;wd Image rule02.gif &#93;&#93;&#34;"
		"			&#34;How do I create a &#34;static&#34; HTML page?&#34;"
		"			&#34;&lt;br>[[&#35;wd Lookup Recipe1 &#93;&#93;&#34;"
		"			&#34;[[&#35;wd Image { /ImageName &#34;MyPhoto.gif&#34; } &#93;&#93;&#34;"
		"		}"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Renderer specification refers to a *.html file:
<pre>[[#wd DisplayAnythingRenderer {
	/AnythingInfo {
		"/MyKey {"
		"	/HTML {"
		"		/TemplateName { RecipeListPage }	# Did you notice? Without '.hmtl'!!!"
		"	}"
		"}"
	}
}]]
</pre>
	The file which then will be read has the name RecipeListPage.html and in this file there might be
	something like:
	<pre>
&lt;table>&lt;tr>&lt;td>
&lt;p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>
How do I create a "static" HTML page?
&lt;br>[[&#35;wd Lookup Recipe1 ]]
&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>	
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;center>&lt;p>[[&#35;wd Image rule02.gif ]]&lt;/center>
	</pre>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition there is a different kind of structure to call 
recursively another renderer specification within the data block, that is:
<pre>
[[&#35;wd 'renderername' 'rendererdata' ]]
<font color=#FF0000>[[&#35;wd Image rule02.gif ]]</font>
[[&#35;wd Image { /ImageName "MyPhoto.gif" } ]]
</pre>
<p>Keep in mind that this only can be used within HTML-Description and that
HTML-Description is possiple as well in an own HTML-File and (quoted) in the 
renderer specification if the Type is HTML !!!

<p>A closer look at the above examples will preserve you from confusion, where to use
which form of the specification.
